PtOEPK Polystyrene Sensors
=========

Pt(II) Octaethylporphine ketone is available from Frontier Scientific, [Catalog# O40969](http://orders.frontiersci.com/Orders/WebPlugin/ProdDetail.aspx?cat=O40969)

Making Sensors:
---------

1. **Dissolve polystyrene beads in toluene.** In a glass jar with a lid combine polystyrene and toluene. Put the lid on and agitate on a shaker overnight for all the PS to dissolve.
2. **Add PtOEPK to toluene/PS solution.** Agitate on shaker until uniformly mixed.
3. **Spin on to substrate to form thin film.** Pipette 50 uL onto a glass slide and spin at 1000 RPM. *Note: Make sure to use a polyethylene transfer pipette as a polystyrene one will dissolve.*
4. **Dry and pre-photobleach.** Place the substrate with the freshly spun sensor in a fume hood and allow the toluene to evaporate overnight. Leave it exposed to light  while drying as this will pre-photobleach it making it more stable.
5. **Cut and embed in your device.** Cut out thin, uniform sections of the sensor and fix them into your device where you want to measure oxygen.
