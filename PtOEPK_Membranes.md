How to make PtOEPK Membranes:
=========

1. Spin an 100-microns-PDMS layer
2. Bake it at 85C for 15 min
3. Add the PtoEpk first on the PDMS layer
4. Add Toluene on top of the PtoEPk and spread the borders using the tip of the transfer pipets
5. Spin the wafer at 600 rpm for 30 sec
6. Bake it at 85C for 30 min (remember to cover it)
7. Once it is cool down, remove the polystyrene carefully from the wafer
8. Rinse the wafer with IPA
