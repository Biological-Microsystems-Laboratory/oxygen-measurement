How to make PtOEPK Membranes:
=========

1. Prepare a 100 micrometer thick PDMS membrane on a wafer.
1. Pipette a small amount of PtOEPK/PS solution onto the PDMS membrane.
1. Pipette several drops of toluene on top of the PtOEPK/PS solution and spread to the borders using the tip of the transfer pipet.
*Note: You must use the polyethylene transfer pipet because toluene is a solvent for other plastics (including polystyrene).*
1. Spin the wafer at 600 rpm for 30 seconds.
1. Bake it at 85C for 30 min (remember to cover it).
1. Allow it to cool and peel the polystyrene carefully from the PDMS membrane.
1. Rinse the PDMS membrane with IPA. 
1. The PDMS should now have a purple color. Cut to size and the sensor is ready to use.
